According to Zimmerman's model Traxler, the "and " enolates lead to the formation of "anti" products. the Transition Status ( I ), corresponding to the product "anti" does not show significant water interactions, while the Transition Status ( II ), corresponding to the product "SYN" shows an interaction "SYN" - unfavorable pentane. consequently, the favored product is "anti".
According to Zimmerman's model Traxler, "Z" cannings lead to the formation of "SYN" products. the Transition Status ( I ), corresponding to the product "SYN" does not show significant water interactions, while the Transition Status ( II), corresponding to the product "anti" shows an interaction "SYN" - unfavorable pentane. consequently, the favored product is "SYN".
